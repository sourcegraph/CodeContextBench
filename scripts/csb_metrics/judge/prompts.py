"""Prompt templates for the CCB LLM Judge.

Three evaluation strategies:
  REFERENCE_CORRECTNESS_PROMPT — when ground-truth answer is available
  REFERENCE_COMPLETENESS_PROMPT — when ground-truth criteria list is available
  DIRECT_REVIEW_PROMPT — fallback when no oracle data exists

Each template uses {placeholders}:
  task_description, agent_output, reference_answer, evaluation_criteria, context_files

Each specifies JSON output with:
  reasoning, dimension_scores (correctness/completeness/code_quality/retrieval_quality/efficiency
  each with score+evidence), overall_score, confidence

REFERENCE_CORRECTNESS_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert code evaluator assessing an AI coding agent's output against \

## Task Description

Compare the agent's output to the reference answer. Score each dimension on a \
