# Kubernetes RBAC Authorization Flow Security Audit

**Repository:** kubernetes/kubernetes
**Task Type:** Security Analysis (analysis only — no code changes)

## Scenario

You are a security engineer auditing the Kubernetes API server's RBAC authorization subsystem. Your goal is to trace the complete authorization flow from when an API request arrives to when a permission decision (allow/deny) is made, mapping the attack surface and identifying security controls.

## Your Task

Analyze the Kubernetes RBAC authorization flow and write a comprehensive security analysis. Trace how API requests are authorized, identify entry points where untrusted input enters the authorization decision path, map the data flow through authorization plugins, and assess the security posture of the RBAC implementation.

Write your analysis to `/logs/agent/solution.md`.

## Required Sections

### Files Examined
- List each file you analyzed and its role in the RBAC authorization flow

### Entry Points
1. Identify where API requests enter the authorization subsystem
2. Identify where RBAC policy data (roles, bindings) enters the system
3. Note any places where untrusted input could influence authorization decisions

### Data Flow
Trace the authorization flow through these stages:
1. **Request arrival** — HTTP handler receives the request
2. **Authentication** — Request identity is established
3. **Authorization filter** — Request is routed to authorizer chain
4. **RBAC evaluation** — Role and binding resolution, permission check
5. **Decision** — Allow/deny outcome and audit logging

For each stage, name the specific file, function, and data structures involved.

### Dependency Chain
Provide an ordered list of files from request entry to authorization decision.

### Analysis
- What vulnerability classes could apply (auth bypass, privilege escalation, policy misconfiguration)?
- What existing mitigations are in place?
- What are the security boundaries between authorization plugins?
- How does the authorizer chain (RBAC, Node, Webhook) interact?

### Summary
Concise description of the RBAC authorization security posture and key findings.

## Constraints

- **Analysis only** — do NOT modify any source files
- Be specific — include file paths, function names, and type names
- Focus on the `plugin/pkg/auth/authorizer/rbac/` and `staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/` directories
