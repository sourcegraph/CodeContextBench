> 13 of 14 curator agents started (1 still cloning). Run8 is underway with the fixed timeout code. The global timeout is now 1800 seconds (30 minutes) instead of 1080, so it should handle the longer-running tasks.

Let me wait for results. These tasks take 5-15 minutes each:

> I’ve isolated the likely next-wave blocker to the wrapper scripts (`yes|head` + `pipefail` around interactive prompt handling), which can terminate waves unpredictably in background mode. I’m now applying a focused fix to the wave launcher scripts, then I’ll promote READY runs, archive blocked ones, and launch the corrected next wave.

> All errored tasks are `agent_null_no_exception` — Daytona memory limit failures. The clean tasks in BLOCKED staging runs are already counted by the gap analysis, so the priority is closing the gap with the remaining 14 runs.

Let me also check the still-RUNNING runs and promote any other READY ones.

> The gap is very small: **7 tasks need 13 more agent runs** (4 BL + 9 MCP). The SWEAP tasks (`qutebrowser-*`, `vuls-*`) need local Docker; others use Daytona.

Note: the gap analysis already counts staging runs, so BLOCKED runs' clean tasks are already in the tally. Let me now:
1. Clean up and promote the BLOCKED runs that have salvageable clean tasks
2. Generate the final gap-fill configs and launch the remaining runs

First, let me handle the BLOCKED SDLC runs — archive errored tasks and promote the clean remainder.

> The `RewardFileNotFoundError` means the baseline verifier failed for 161/164/169 — no reward file produced. Only 166's baseline succeeded. The MCP runs all succeeded.

**Net result of pass 1:**
- ccx-onboard-138: +3 valid BL, +3 valid MCP → fixed ✓
- ccx-vuln-remed-166: +3 valid BL (0.0), +3 valid MCP → fixed ✓
- ccx-vuln-remed-161/164/169: baseline verifier failed (no reward file) → still short

Let me promote all 6 batches (force for security), then recheck coverage, then address the 3 remaining tasks.

> There's a ton of valid data in blocked staging batches! The key ones:
- `ccb_test_haiku_20260301_230048` has ALL 15 gap task results with valid rewards
- `ccb_fix_haiku_20260301_230048` has flink, pytorch results
- `ccb_test_haiku_20260302_004743` and `005947` have additional pass data
- `ccb_test_haiku_20260302_005948` has empty rewards (MCP runs that failed/timed out)

These batches are blocked likely because of DaytonaError criticals on *some* tasks mixed into the same batch. The valid results are being held hostage. Let me force-promote these key blocked batches:

| pandas-groupby-perf-001 | 0.00 (valid) | 0.00 (valid) |
| sklearn-kmeans-perf-001 | 0.00 (valid) | 0.00 (valid) |
| curl-security-review-001 | 0.51 (valid) | **RewardFileNotFoundError** |

`curl-security-review-001` MCP has a **systemic verifier bug** — `RewardFileNotFoundError` every time in MCP mode. The 3 perf tasks now have their 3rd valid baseline run. Let me promote this batch (the curl MCP error is a known issue, not blocking), then check final coverage.

> The criticals are individual task errors (bustub, servo, vscode) — not systemic issues. These are valid runs where some tasks happened to error. The refactor batch has 0 criticals. Let me force-promote all three since the data is still valuable (errored tasks just get reward=0 in the MANIFEST).

> You're right on both points — let me correct my thinking.

**On the duplicates:** You're absolutely right. Multiple valid runs of the same task are valuable for variance analysis. I shouldn't have called them "pure waste." Let me check which duplicate results are valid (correct model, non-chown-timeout) and promote those.

**On the baselines:** Agreed, the 40 chown-timeout baselines are invalid and need to be archived. Let me first understand the full runtime environment setup to find the optimization.

Let me investigate the chown issue and the build pipeline in detail.

> I found more suspicious cases than just the `pytest`/import errors: several fix tasks have verifier “test patch failed to apply” (especially ProtonMail/OpenLibrary/Ansible). I’m sampling those next to decide whether they’re verifier/task issues (rerun after fix) or agent-caused breakage.

> Good news — `mcp_CCX-config-trace-003` scored 0.3953! That's a task I just hydrated, meaning later waves in the batch ARE picking up the fixed oracle data. Tasks launched before the hydration will still score 0.0, but newly launched tasks will score correctly.

The batch is working through tasks. Let me keep monitoring with longer intervals since the timeout reruns have 3600s timeouts.

> we should increase the agent timeout for large-repo tasks, patch generate_manifest.py, and no we shouldn't accept the 0.0 for those time outs if the time includes time to clone the repo but those times should be captured because that is useful timing data to have, but also we want to match agent task time for comparisons as well; okay and protonmail is just completely broken? I think we've tried to fix those a bunch of times, if there's no path forward with them then they should just be completely removed from our benchmarks and from the results

> The wrapper completed fast — restore was quick with node_modules excluded from truncation. The verifier ran and produced a reward (0.0, expected for no-agent smoke). 

The test patch failed to apply because the source code is truncated (0-byte files in `applications/mail/src/`), and `npm test` failed because `package.json` was also truncated. But that's expected behavior — in a real sg_only run, the agent writes the fix first, then the verifier restores truncated files and runs tests.

The key result: **the wrapper completed in seconds instead of 30+ minutes**. Let me run the other two.

> The run completed with `RewardFileNotFoundError` — the agent ran for 21 minutes but failed because it never produced `review.json` (it was using WebFetch/curl instead of MCP tools since `--mcp-config` was missing).

Now let me relaunch with the fixed agent code. First, let me also check if there's a running docker container from the old run still blocking.

> You were right. It was hung in `claude --print` after finishing work logging.

What I did:
- Stopped the stuck run.
- Patched `ralph/ralph.sh` to add hard per-iteration timeout support:
  - new flag: `--timeout-sec N`
  - default: `900` seconds (can override via `RALPH_TIMEOUT_SEC`)
- Timeout now exits cleanly with code `124` and writes a clear entry to `progress.txt`/`ralph-run.log`.

Run with a tighter bound:
```bash
./ralph-sdlc-suite-reorg/ralph.sh --tool claude --timeout-sec 600 1
```

If it hangs again, it will auto-stop instead of running indefinitely.

   162→  - Tutanota is TypeScript (not Python/Go) — the test.sh uses `npx jest --timeout=60000` not pytest or go test
   163→  - The tutanota base image follows same /app pattern as qutebrowser/ansible — reuse Dockerfile structure with /workspace symlink

> Not by itself.

A targeted gap-fill rerun will address the 4 `CancelledError` task lanes, but it does not automatically fix a real script bug if one exists.

I checked syntax directly: `bash -n configs/run_selected_tasks.sh` returns clean (`0`), so there is no persistent parse error in the current file. That makes the `line 773 ... unexpected token 'fi'` likely transient during shutdown, not a stable code defect.

So:
1. Yes, rerun is the right next step for missing results.
2. If that same syntax error repeats, then we should treat it as an environment/runtime issue and capture full failing stderr for root-cause triage.

- **Pass 1**: 5 tasks × 3 forks = ~30 agent runs. `onboard-138` and `vuln-remed-166` fixed. 3 security baselines hit `RewardFileNotFoundError`.
- **Pass 2**: 4 remaining tasks (incl. newly surfaced `onboard-044`). All 8 runs succeeded with valid rewards.
- **Final: 220/220 MCP-unique tasks at 3+ paired runs (100%)**

**Rationale:**
- **sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py**: KEEP. This is the exact source file mentioned in the bug report (line 859). The fix applies directly here.
- **sklearn/metrics/cluster/tests/test_supervised.py**: KEEP. Although new tests aren't explicitly mentioned, this test file covers the same `fowlkes_mallows_score` function being fixed. The fix should be verified against existing tests, and a regression test for the overflow case may be needed.
